# Inhabitent Custom WordPress Theme

Inhabitent is a WordPress theme based off of Underscores. Project 4 for RED Academy (and the first one done in PHP!).

## Project Description

Inhabitent is Vancouver's lead imaginary camping supply store. The custom theme created for them includes one custom post type ("products") and one custom taxonomy ("product type"), as well as one custom widget that lets the client set their business hours. The "about" page is also client-friendly, allowing the client to upload their own banner image through the WordPress backend. The addition of a "journal" means that the company can now easily make blog posts to showcase their products and spread their message.
